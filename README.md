# hipshoot

# Documentation

Documentation is available at [bloomreach-forge.github.io/camel-events-support](https://bloomreach-forge.github.io/camel-events-support)

The documentation is generated by this command from the master branch:

 > mvn clean site:site -Pgithub.pages

The output is in the ```/docs``` directory; push it and GitHub Pages will serve the site automatically.

For rendering documentation on non-master branches, use the normal site command so the output will be in the ```/target```
and therefore ignored by Git.

 > mvn clean site:site
